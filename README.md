## Overview

The OpenLDR API provides REST endpoints for analytics and reporting across Tuberculosis GeneXpert (TB GX), HIV Viral Load (VL), HIV EID, dictionary/reference data, and authentication. The API includes JWT-based authentication, Clerk webhook integration, Swagger documentation via Flasgger, and patient endpoints with pagination.

## API Documentation

### Active Route Modules

The API currently registers the following route modules in `app.py`:

| Module | Prefix | Route file |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Authentication | `/auth/*` | `auth/routes.py` |
| Dictionary | `/dict/*` | `dict/routes.py` |
| TB GeneXpert | `/tb/gx/*` | `tb/gxpert/routes.py` |
| HIV Viral Load | `/hiv/vl/*` | `hiv/vl/routes.py` |
| HIV EID | `/hiv/eid/*` | `hiv/eid/routes.py` |

> Note: `tb/cultura` exists in the repository but is not currently registered in `app.py`.

### Authentication Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `POST` | `/auth/login` | Login with username and password, returns JWT token | No |
| `POST` | `/auth/create` | Create a new user (Admin only) | Yes (JWT) |
| `PUT` | `/auth/update` | Update user details (Admin only) | Yes (JWT) |
| `DELETE` | `/auth/delete` | Delete a user (Admin only) | Yes (JWT) |
| `GET` | `/auth/users` | Get all users (Admin only) | Yes (JWT) |
| `POST` | `/auth/clerk` | Clerk webhook handler for external auth events | No (Webhook) |

#### Clerk Webhook Events

The `/auth/clerk` endpoint handles the following Clerk events:

- **`session.created`** — Logs in an existing user or auto-creates a new one
- **`session.removed`** / **`session.ended`** — Logs out the user
- **`user.created`** — Creates a new user from Clerk data
- **`user.updated`** — Updates user info from Clerk data
- **`user.deleted`** — Deletes the user

## Pagination

Patient endpoints support server-side pagination to handle large datasets efficiently. Pagination is applied at the SQL query level using `OFFSET`/`LIMIT` for optimal performance.

### Pagination Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `page` | integer | `1` | Page number (1-indexed) |
| `per_page` | integer | `50` | Number of records per page |

### Paginated Response Format

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 50,
    "total_count": 1234,
    "total_pages": 25,
    "data": [
        {
            "request_id": "REQ001",
            "first_name": "John",
            "last_name": "Doe",
            "health_facility": "CS Example",
            "final_result": "MTB Detected",
            ...
        }
    ]
}
```

### Example Requests

```
GET /tb/gx/patients/by_name/?first_name=Ana&page=1&per_page=20
GET /tb/gx/patients/by_facility/?health_facility=CS%20Mongue&page=2&per_page=50
GET /tb/gx/patients/by_sample_type/?sample_type=sputum&page=1&per_page=100
GET /tb/gx/patients/by_result_type/?result_type=detected&page=3&per_page=50
```

## Authentication

The API uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication with two integration paths:

- Access tokens are configured to expire after **60 minutes**.

### Direct Login

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "your_password"}'
```

The response includes a JWT token:

```json
{
    "message": "Login successful",
    "data": {
        "user_id": "...",
        "user_name": "admin",
        "first_name": "Admin",
        "last_name": "User",
        "email_address": "admin@example.com",
        "role": "Admin"
    },
    "token": "eyJhbGciOi...",
    "status": 200
}
```

### Using the Token

Include the token in the `Authorization` header for protected endpoints:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi..." \
  http://localhost:5000/tb/gx/patients/by_name/?first_name=Ana
```

### Clerk Integration

The API supports [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) as an external identity provider via webhook events at `/auth/clerk`. When a user authenticates through Clerk:

1. **New users** are automatically created in the local database
2. **Existing users** receive a new JWT access token
3. **User updates/deletions** from Clerk are synced to the local database
4. All events are logged to the `UserLogs` table

### Roles

- **Admin** — Full access to all endpoints, including patient data and user management
- **user** — Standard access (default role for Clerk-provisioned users)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- SQL Server (via `pyodbc`)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd OpenLDR_API
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .env
   # Windows
   .env\Scripts\activate
   # Linux/macOS
   source .env/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the application:
   - Configuration is loaded from `configs/paths.py`.
   - **Windows**: values are read from `configs/configs.ini`.
   - **Linux**: values are read from environment variables.
   - In `app.py`, choose the active SQLAlchemy bind dictionary (currently `SQLALCHEMY_BINDS_CDR_OPENLDR_ORG_MZ`).
   - Ensure `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` (Linux) or `Flask.secret_key` (Windows), database credentials, and Clerk settings are configured.

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Access the API documentation at: `http://localhost:5000/apidocs/`

## Deployment

### Production (Waitress + NSSM on Windows)

```bash
waitress-serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=9001 app:app
```

To register as a Windows service using NSSM:

### Database/driver notes

- SQL Server is required for normal operation.
- Connection strings use `ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server`.
- Confirm network access to the configured SQL Server hosts.

## Testing

The repository includes pytest tests in `tests/`.

```bash
# Unit-style utility tests
pytest tests/test_utils.py

# Full test suite
pytest tests -q

# Optional live integration checks (requires DB connectivity)
pytest tests/test_hiv_endpoints.py -s
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Errors
- **Issue**: `InterfaceError: ('IM002', '[IM002] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found'`
- **Solution**: Install ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server and verify connection string format

#### JWT Token Issues
- **Issue**: `401 Unauthorized` despite valid login
- **Solution**: Check `SECRET_KEY` configuration and token expiration time

#### CORS Issues
- **Issue**: Browser blocks API requests from frontend
- **Solution**: Verify `Flask-CORS` configuration and allowed origins

#### Performance Issues
- **Issue**: Slow response times on large datasets
- **Solution**: Use pagination, optimize database queries, add indexes

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed error information:

```python
# In app.py
app.run(debug=True)
```

### Logging

Check application logs for detailed error information:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | Invalid Parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized (missing or invalid token) |
| 403 | Forbidden (insufficient role permissions) |
| 404 | Resource Not Found |
| 500 | Internal Server Error |

### Error Response Format

```json
{
    "status": 500,
    "error": "Internal Server Error",
    "message": "Detailed error description"
}
```

### Patient Service Error Example

```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "code": 403,
    "message": "Forbidden - User with id abc123 and role user is not authorized to access this resource."
}
```
